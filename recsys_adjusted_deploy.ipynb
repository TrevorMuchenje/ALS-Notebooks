    "Typically in Machine Learning applications, we need to test whether the model we just trained is any good on new data it hasn't yet seen before from the training phase. We do this by creating a test set completely separate from the training set. Usually this is fairly simple: just take a random sample of the training example rows in our feature matrix and separate it away from the training set. That normally looks like this:\n",
    "With collaborative filtering, that's not going to work because you need all of the user/item interactions to find the proper matrix factorization. A better method is to hide a certain percentage of the user/item interactions from the model during the training phase chosen at random. Then, check during the test phase how many of the items that were recommended the user actually ended up purchasing in the end. Ideally, you would ultimately test your recommendations with some kind of A/B test or utilizing data from a time series where all data prior to a certain point in time is used for training while data after a certain period of time is used for testing.\n",
    "For this example, because the time period is only 8 months and because of the purchasing type (products), it is most likely products won't be purchased again in a short time period anyway. This will be a better test. You can see an example here:\n",
    "Our test set is an exact copy of our original data. The training set, however, will mask a random percentage of user/item interactions and act as if the user never purchased the item (making it a sparse entry with a zero). We then check in the test set which items were recommended to the user that they ended up actually purchasing. If the users frequently ended up purchasing the items most recommended to them by the system, we can conclude the system seems to be working.\n",
    "As an additional check, we can compare our system to simply recommending the most popular items to every user (beating popularity is a bit difficult). This will be our baseline.\n",
    "This method of testing isn't necessarily the \"correct\" answer, because it depends on how you want to use the recommender system. However, it is a practical way of testing performance I will use for this example.\n",

    "Remember that our training set had 20% of the purchases masked? This will allow us to evaluate the performance of our recommender system. Essentially, we need to see if the order of recommendations given for each user matches the items they ended up purchasing. A commonly used metric for this kind of problem is the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (or ROC) curve. A greater area under the curve means we are recommending items that end up being purchased near the top of the list of recommended items. Usually this metric is used in more typical binary classification problems to identify how well a model can predict a positive example vs. a negative one. It will also work well for our purposes of ranking recommendations.\n",
    "In order to do that, we need to write a function that can calculate a mean area under the curve (AUC) for any user that had at least one masked item. As a benchmark, we will also calculate what the mean AUC would have been if we had simply recommended the most popular items. Popularity tends to be hard to beat in most recommender system problems, so it makes a good comparison.\n",
